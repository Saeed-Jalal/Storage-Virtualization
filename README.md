# Storage-Virtualization
In this hands on lab, we will see how users can configure a Windows virtual machine to use storage
virtualization. Use the Storage Spaces feature and configure storage with different properties. How
does the user configure at least one virtual storage device with two-way mirror resiliency and one
with parity resiliency.
We will verify the functionality of the resiliency by removing one of the drives associated to the
storage pool.
